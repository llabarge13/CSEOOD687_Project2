# CSE687 Project 2: Map Reduce
May 12, 2022

Authors: Todd Hricik, Lyndsay LaBarge

## Overview
The Visual Studio Solution contains five seperate projects. 

The MapReduce project contains the implementation of the primary command line application.

The UnitTests project contains our Google Unit tests.

The Interfaces project contains out map and reduce interfaces, IMap and IReduce. These are template abstract classes.

The MapLibrary project contains our DLL library with our concrete Map class implementation.

The ReduceLibrary project contains our DLL library with our concrete Reduce class implementation.

We used C++ 17 and the boost C++ library (version 1.79). We used the boost Filesystem as opposed to implementating our own file management class.

## Build
All projects use a properties sheet. To build the projects, you will need to change the values of the user macros BoostRoot and BoostLib in MapReduce > PropertySheet.props, UnitTests > PropertySheet.props, Interfaces > PropertySheet.props, MapLibrary > PropertySheet.props, and ReduceLibrary > PropertySheet.props. By default they are set to `C:\Program Files\boost\boost_ 1_79_0` and `C:\Program Files\boost\boost_1_79_0\stage\lib`. To build, use either the Debug or Release configuration for x64 platforms.

## Usage
```
MapReduce.exe <path of dir containging input files> <path of dir for intermediate files> <path of dir for output files <path of map DLL> <path of reduce DLL>
```
All command line requirements are required. 

The input directory must contain UTF-8 encoded text files. If the input directory contains a file that does not meet the requirements, that file will be skipped during processing.

If the intermediate directory or the output directory does not already exist, the application will create the directories.

## Expected Output
### Command
```
.\MapReduce.exe "..\..\MapReduce\shakespeare" ".\temp" ".\output" ".\MapLibrary.dll" ".\ReduceLibrary.dll"
```
### Command Line Output 
```

```

### File Output
Assuming the application completed with no errors, the results of the map reduce operation are located in the specified output directory. It will output 2 files.

`reduce.txt` - file containing the map reduce output

`SUCCESS` - file indicating the operation completed successfully


## Unit Test Results
The unit tests are defined in UnitTests\tests.cpp. There are unit tests for the Map, Sort, Reduce, and Workflow calsses.
